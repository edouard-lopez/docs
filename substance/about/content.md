# Introduction

Substance is a completely free and open technology stack motivated by the idea of taking a pure data-driven approach to working with digital documents. From content creation to publishing we believe that there should be better tools that address the problem from a fresh angle.

## Semantic editing

Unlike traditional word-processors, Substance focusses on content, by leaving the layout part to the system not the user. Because of the abscence of formatting utilities, it suggests structured, content-oriented writing.

## Content is data

Substance considers content as data, which allows digital documents to be queried like a database. With little effort, you can take the Substance data format and display it the way you want.

## Open Collaboration

Substance targets open collaboration. Everyone should be able to contribute to a document, without the hurdles.

Consider the following document:

Wouldn't it be nice to just express your feelings right away?

Substance offers inline annotations (markers) as well as comments to allow exactly that.

## Extensible

There's no one size fits it all solution. Hence we defined a simple plugin system to make it easy for developers to create their own content types and share them with the Substance development community.

## Open Source

Behind the scenes the Substance is mainly composed by a stack of open source modules that will be publicly released under the Open Source MIT license.

## eLife Lens

We are collaborating with Open Access publishers and have implemented a new way to display scientific content, eLife Lens. This tool is built on top of the Substance technology stack and has been successfully integrated by  eLife and Landes Bioscience.

# Work with us

Do you see Substance work for your use-case? Contact us at info@substance.io. We're happy to discuss options how Substance can be integrated with your application use-cases.

# Contribute

We’ve been developing Substance for three years now without any funding, making this a project mainly built out of voluntary effort. Our goal is making Substance an open standard for interoperable digital publishing.

You can report bugs and discuss features on [GitHub](http://github.com/substance), on Freenode in the `#_substance` IRC channel, or send tweets to [@_substance](http://twitter.com/_substance).
And if that's not enough, post to our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/substance_).

We just realized the more concrete our goals get, the more we see the need to spend dedicated time on development, in order to come to the day when we can say "It’s finally here!". Please help us by supporting our [campaign](http://www.pledgie.com/campaigns/18902) and spread the word about it. 

# Thanks

We'd like to thank anybody who supported the project from the beginning. We've received code contributions from people all over the world. Among them (in chronological order) [Samo Korosec](http://dribbble.com/froodee), [Tim Baumann](https://github.com/timjb), [Victor Saiz](https://github.com/vectorsize) and [Daniel Beilinson](https://github.com/Integral). They all helped to shape the idea and implementation.

Our most recent work was backed by a [Shuttleworth](http://www.shuttleworthfoundation.org/) Flash Grant that we received earlier this year.

We'd also like to thank anyone who supported our Pledgie campaign. The bad news is we didn't reach our funding goal. The good news is we got the proposed release ready anyway. We were working hard on the past 6 months and reimplemented Substance from scratch. A solid foundation is now ready, paving the way for exciting use-cases and applications.
